### Payne & Escalona et al 2025. In press.
Scripts used to generate a Cutthroat Trout distribution map and 
chromosome alignment dotoplot figures for the 
Lahontan Cutthroat Trout (Pilot Peak strain) genome assembly

### Included scripts:
- cutthroat-trout-range-map_penaluna.R: Cutthroat Trout subspecies distribution map with historical and contemporary ranges
- mummer_all-chr-v-chr_grid.R: Matrix of pairwise MUMmer alignments visualized as dot plots between assemblies 
- mummer_dot_plots.R: MUMmer alignments visualized as dot plots
